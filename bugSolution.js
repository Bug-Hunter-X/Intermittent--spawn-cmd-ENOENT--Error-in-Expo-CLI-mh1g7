The core issue is likely related to environment inconsistencies rather than code within the project. To improve the reliability of `expo start`, ensure the following:

1. **Update Node.js and npm:** Verify that Node.js and npm are up-to-date using `node -v` and `npm -v` respectively. If not, update to the latest LTS versions.
2. **Check Environment Variables:** Certain environment variables might interfere with the CLI.  Try temporarily disabling any non-essential environment variables to see if this resolves the issue. 
3. **Reinstall Expo CLI:** If the problem persists, uninstall and reinstall the Expo CLI: `npm uninstall -g expo-cli` followed by `npm install -g expo-cli`.
4. **Restart your computer:** Sometimes a simple restart will fix strange environment issues.
5. **Check path variables:**  Ensure that Node.js and npm are in your system's PATH environment variable. This allows your system to find the executables correctly.
