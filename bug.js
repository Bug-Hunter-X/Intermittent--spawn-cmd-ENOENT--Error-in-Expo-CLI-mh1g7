While working on an Expo project, I encountered an unusual error related to the Expo CLI.  When attempting to run `expo start`, I received the following error message: `Error: spawn cmd ENOENT`. This error appeared inconsistently, sometimes working on the first attempt, others only after multiple restarts or terminal sessions. No clear patterns were detected in the project setup or dependencies that triggered this error.
