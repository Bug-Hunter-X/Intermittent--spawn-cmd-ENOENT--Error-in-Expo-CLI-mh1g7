# Intermittent 'spawn cmd ENOENT' Error in Expo CLI

This repository demonstrates an intermittent error encountered while using the Expo CLI. The error, `Error: spawn cmd ENOENT`, occurs unpredictably when running `expo start`.  The issue appears to be related to the underlying process spawning mechanism, potentially due to environment inconsistencies or temporary conflicts.

## Reproduction

Reproducing the error is inconsistent by design. The bug file (bug.js) demonstrates a simple Expo app.  The key is the inconsistent behavior of `expo start`.  Sometimes it works correctly, other times it throws the ENOENT error.

## Solution

The proposed solution (in bugSolution.js) focuses on improving the robustness of the development environment. This includes ensuring Node.js and npm are up-to-date, verifying environment variables, and potentially reinstalling the Expo CLI.
